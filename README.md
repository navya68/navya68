I’m an **AI & Cloud enthusiast** interested in how **Generative AI can create human-centered, empathetic communication experiences**. I enjoy experimenting with prompts, narratives, and AI-generated content to understand how technology can influence user behavior in a positive way.

I’m especially curious about **AI storytelling, habit-building communication, and UX-focused content**, particularly in fintech and real-world products.
